Not CS person
controls were weird, would be easier to go if arrows moved left and right
you can get "stuck" on a wall
all the wall colors blend together and make it hard to see through the maze
you can turn around and walk into the void behind you
What i did to fix it:
added textures so that the walls were not just one solid color mass
make the space between the player and the walls a little bigger so you wouldn't hit them as often
added a little starting arena so you can't walk away, but I left the maze open at the end so you could run off if you wanted to

lack of music and sound
controls are difficult, would be eaiser with just normal arrow keys
lack of sound makes game seem scary 
no reward at the end
what i did to fix it:
added in some calming background music 
made wall length wider so it would be easier to change
made the game open-world at the end to be the player's reward of "freedom"
