Though I finished everything on my "needs to have" list, I only got halfway in completing anything on my "nice to have" list. I started implimenting both sound effects and collectable objects but when I hit a roadblock for one 
I pivoted to making the other, which left me not enough time to commit to making one entirely possible. When I switched repos I also found that I couldn't commit changes to it for some reason (no matter how many edits 
it would always say "no local changes"), so for the last week I noted all my daily progress in the notes of the game file itself. Although from an outside perspective it looks technically impressive, I used p5js's built
in 3d program instead, which is very easy to use once you understand it, so I'm not really that satisfied with the final outcome of the game itself since it feels unfinished. If I could start the project again I would
focus on adding one thing from my "nice to haves" list instead of switching around while making them so I would be able to actually add it in the end. Also while making it I had the idea to add a 3d trophy at the end
for when you make it out but I didn't have the time, so instead I just mapped a trophy over a ball and called it a day.
